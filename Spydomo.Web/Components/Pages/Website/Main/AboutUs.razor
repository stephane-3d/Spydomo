    <h2>Why We Built Spydomo</h2>
    <p>
        We’re a small creative team from Québec City, Canada - entrepreneurs, marketers, and product folks who’ve all
        felt the same pain: trying to keep up with competitors, customer trends, and shifting market dynamics…
        without turning it into a second job.
    </p>
    <p>
        We were tired of juggling review sites, community threads, social feeds, newsletters, and launch posts just to
        answer simple questions like: <em>“What’s really going on in our market?”</em> or <em>
            “What are users actually
            complaining about?”
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Spydomo was born to fix that. First for our own use, then for other teams who think like us: fast-moving B2B
        teams who want clarity and competitive awareness without the grunt work.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Work</h2>

    <h3>Calm competitive awareness, not panic dashboards</h3>
    <p>
        We don’t believe in firehoses of alerts or dashboards that create more anxiety than answers. Spydomo is built
        as a calm radar, not a flashing siren.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of showing you everything, we curate what matters:
        launches, patterns in reviews, emerging complaints, shifts in positioning. The goal is a short, readable
        briefing you can scan in a few minutes and then get back to building.
    </p>

    <h3>With builders, not bureaucracy</h3>
    <p>
        Spydomo is not designed for corporate “competitive intelligence” departments and 40-page slide decks.
        It’s for people who actually ship:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i class="ph ph-target" aria-hidden="true"></i> Founders, product leaders, and B2B SaaS teams who need a live feel for their market</li>
        <li><i class="ph ph-trend-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> Growth &amp; content agencies juggling multiple clients and verticals</li>
        <li><i class="ph ph-magnifying-glass" aria-hidden="true"></i> Anyone who wants market awareness without hours of manual research</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That’s why our product, pricing, and UX stay simple. No opaque enterprise contracts, no “talk to sales” just to
        get started—just track the companies you care about and let the system work for you.
    </p>

    <h3>The customer’s voice over vanity metrics</h3>
    <p>
        Follower counts and launch announcements can be entertaining, but they’re not where the real insight lives.
        We put the spotlight on what users actually say.
    </p>
    <p>
        Spydomo pulls in reviews, discussions, and mentions, then normalizes and groups them into clear themes—
        so instead of 27 slightly different complaints, you see one clear pattern like
        <em>“slow onboarding”</em> or <em>“support is hard to reach”</em>. We care less about who shouts the loudest,
        and more about what it feels like to use the product.
    </p>

    <h3>Playing the long game with history and context</h3>
    <p>
        Market awareness isn’t a one-off research project; it’s a story unfolding over time. As you use Spydomo, you
        build a history of themes, sentiment, and signals around your competitive landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
        We help you see not just what happened this week, but how it fits into the bigger narrative:
        recurring pain points, improving areas, new threats, and shifting positioning. Over time, Spydomo becomes the
        place where your team remembers what happened, why it mattered, and how you responded.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do (In Plain Terms)</h2>
    <p>
        Spydomo tracks the companies and markets you care about, collects relevant content (reviews, discussions,
        company updates), and turns it into a curated feed of signals and stats. You get:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A clear view of what customers praise, complain about, and ask for</li>
        <li>Signals when competitors launch, shift positioning, or hit recurring issues</li>
        <li>History and context so you can see trends instead of isolated anecdotes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        Our goal is to become your team’s quiet competitive edge—a living pulse of your market that keeps you ahead,
        inspired, and confidently strategic, without adding noise or busywork.
