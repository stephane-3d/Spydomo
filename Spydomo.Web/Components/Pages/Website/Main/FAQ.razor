        <MudExpansionPanel Text="What is Spydomo?">
            Spydomo is your competitive radar. We monitor your market, analyze signals from reviews,
            content, and chatter, and deliver smart summaries to help you stay ahead — without the grunt work.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Who is it for?">
            We built Spydomo for B2B SaaS founders, marketers, and product teams — as well as agencies managing
            multiple clients who need a constant pulse on competitors.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="How often is the data updated?">
            We refresh your tracked companies on a rolling basis — usually every few days depending on the source.
            You’ll always see the latest insights without lifting a finger.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Can I choose which companies to track?">
            Yes! You choose the companies that matter to you — competitors, partners, or even your own brand.
            We take care of the rest.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Do you offer a free trial?">
            We currently offer a 14-day free trial so you can see how Spydomo fits into your workflow.
            No long-term commitment. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at any time.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Where is your data coming from?">
            We collect data from public sources like review sites (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius), LinkedIn posts,
            Reddit discussions, and more. Everything is summarized into useful, categorized insights about companies
            and products — not about individuals.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Is my data safe?">
            Absolutely. We never sell your data, and we only use trusted infrastructure and service providers
            to run Spydomo. You remain the owner of your account data, and you can delete it at any time.
            For the details, see our <a href="/privacy" class="text-primary">Privacy Policy</a> and
            <a href="/dpa" class="text-primary">Data Processing Agreement</a>.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Do you track individual people?">
            No. Spydomo is focused on companies and products, not individuals. We analyze public reviews and
            discussions to extract themes, trends, and signals at the company level. We don’t build behavior profiles
            of specific people, and we only keep raw content as long as needed to generate aggregated insights.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="How do you handle GDPR and data protection?">
            We designed Spydomo with modern privacy laws in mind, including GDPR. When we process personal data on
            your behalf, our <a href="/dpa" class="text-primary">DPA</a> applies. EU and UK users keep all of their
            usual rights (access, correction, deletion, etc.), and we’re happy to help you exercise them — just reach
            out at <a href="mailto:info@spydomo.com" class="text-primary">info@spydomo.com</a>.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Do you use cookies or tracking pixels?">
            We use privacy-friendly analytics (Plausible) to understand overall usage, without cookies or cross-site
            tracking. We don’t run ad pixels or retargeting scripts. If this ever changes, we’ll update our Privacy
            Policy accordingly.
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="What happens if I cancel?">
            You can cancel at any time. Your subscription will stop at the end of the current billing period
            and you won’t be charged again. We may retain some data for legitimate reasons (like billing records),
            but if you want your account completely removed, just email us at
            <a href="mailto:info@spydomo.com" class="text-primary">info@spydomo.com</a>.
