    <h3>About this DPA</h3>
    <p>
        This Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") explains how Spydomo processes personal data
        on behalf of our customers when they use our services.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using Spydomo and agreeing to our Terms of Service, you are also agreeing to this DPA.
        You do not need to sign a separate document. We provide the same privacy protections
        and data processing commitments to all customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your organization requires a signed copy of this DPA, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:info@spydomo.com">info@spydomo.com</a> and we will provide a countersigned version.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">1. Definitions</h4>
    <p>
        Terms such as <strong>Personal Data</strong>, <strong>Processing</strong>,
        <strong>Controller</strong>, <strong>Processor</strong>, <strong>Data Subject</strong>
        and <strong>Supervisory Authority</strong> have the meanings given in applicable
        data protection laws (including the GDPR and UK GDPR).
        <strong>Applicable Data Protection Laws</strong> means all laws relating to data protection
        and privacy that apply to the Processing under this DPA.
        A <strong>Subprocessor</strong> is a third party engaged by Spydomo to Process Personal Data
        on behalf of the customer.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">2. Subject Matter and Duration</h4>
    <p>
        This DPA applies where Spydomo processes Personal Data on behalf of the customer
        in connection with the Spydomo service (the “Services”).
        The Processing will continue for the term of the Main Agreement between the customer
        and Spydomo and until all Personal Data is deleted or returned in accordance with this DPA.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">3. Nature and Purpose of Processing</h4>
    <p>
        Spydomo provides a competitive intelligence and insights platform for software companies.
        Spydomo Processes Personal Data as necessary to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, and support the Services</li>
        <li>Maintain security, monitor performance, and prevent abuse</li>
        <li>Provide customer support and handle requests from the customer</li>
        <li>Improve and develop the Services, in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Laws</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">4. Types of Personal Data and Data Subjects</h4>
    <p>
        Personal Data Processed under this DPA may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Business contact details (e.g., name, email address, company, job title)</li>
        <li>Account and login information for users of the Services</li>
        <li>Usage data and technical data related to use of the Services</li>
        <li>
            Text or other content submitted to the Services by or on behalf of the customer,
            which may incidentally include Personal Data depending on how the customer uses Spydomo
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Categories of Data Subjects may include the customer’s employees, contractors, and contacts,
        and other individuals whose data is included in content provided or connected by the customer.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">5. Roles of the Parties</h4>
    <p>
        For Personal Data covered by this DPA:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The customer is the <strong>Controller</strong> of the Personal Data.</li>
        <li>Spydomo is the <strong>Processor</strong> processing Personal Data on behalf of the customer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Nothing in this DPA prevents Spydomo from acting as an independent Controller for certain data,
        for example data about its own customers and marketing activities, as described in Spydomo’s
        Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">6. Spydomo’s Obligations as Processor</h4>
    <p>Spydomo shall:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from the customer, including with
            respect to transfers, unless required to do so by law. In such a case, Spydomo will inform
            the customer unless the law prohibits this.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ensure that persons authorized to Process Personal Data are bound by appropriate confidentiality
            obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against
            accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access.
        </li>
        <li>
            Notify the customer without undue delay after becoming aware of a Personal Data breach affecting
            Personal Data Processed on behalf of the customer, and provide information reasonably available
            to assist the customer in meeting its obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Taking into account the nature of the Processing, assist the customer by appropriate technical
            and organizational measures, where possible, in responding to Data Subject requests to exercise
            their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws.
        </li>
        <li>
            Where required by law, assist the customer with data protection impact assessments and consultations
            with supervisory authorities in relation to the Services.
        </li>
        <li>
            Upon termination of the Main Agreement, delete or return Personal Data to the customer, at the
            customer’s choice, unless retention is required by law. Aggregated or anonymized data that no
            longer constitutes Personal Data may be retained by Spydomo.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">7. Subprocessors</h4>

    <p>
        We work with a small number of subprocessors to help us deliver Spydomo. For each subprocessor,
        we assess their security and privacy practices and enter into a data processing agreement
        that includes appropriate data protection safeguards (such as the controller–processor
        Standard Contractual Clauses where required).
    </p>

    <p>
        Any such subprocessors are permitted to process personal data only as necessary to provide
        the services Spydomo has engaged them to deliver, and they are prohibited from using the data
        for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may update our list of subprocessors from time to time as we evolve our infrastructure.
        Where required by applicable law or by our agreements with you, we will notify you of material
        changes (for example via email, in-app notifications, or by updating our website). If you have
        a legitimate objection to a new subprocessor, you may notify us and, if we cannot reasonably
        address your objection, you may terminate the affected services in accordance with the Main Agreement.
    </p>

    <SubprocessorsTable />

    <h4 class="mt-4">8. International Transfers</h4>
    <p>
        Where the Processing of Personal Data involves transfers outside the EEA or UK to a country not
        deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, Spydomo shall ensure that such transfers are
        made in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws, for example by implementing appropriate
        safeguards such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and, where applicable, the UK International
        Data Transfer Addendum.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">9. Audits</h4>
    <p>
        Spydomo shall make available to the customer information reasonably necessary to demonstrate
        compliance with this DPA and, where required by law, allow for and contribute to audits, including
        inspections, by the customer or an auditor mandated by the customer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any audit shall be subject to reasonable prior notice, occur no more than once in any 12-month period
        (unless required by a supervisory authority or in response to a confirmed incident), be conducted
        during normal business hours, and not unreasonably disrupt Spydomo’s business. The customer shall
        bear its own costs and any third-party costs of such audit.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">10. Customer Obligations</h4>
    <p>
        The customer is responsible for ensuring that it has a valid legal basis for Processing Personal Data
        and for providing such data to Spydomo in connection with the Services, for providing any required
        notices to Data Subjects, and for obtaining any required consents. The customer agrees that it will
        not submit special categories of personal data to the Services unless the parties have explicitly
        agreed otherwise in writing.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">11. Miscellaneous</h4>
    <p>
        In the event of any conflict between this DPA and the Main Agreement, this DPA shall prevail with respect
        to the Processing of Personal Data. This DPA shall be governed by the same law and jurisdiction as the
        Main Agreement, unless otherwise required by Applicable Data Protection Laws.
