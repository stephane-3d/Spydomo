    <p>
        Spydomo (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information
        when you use our website and services.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">1. Information We Collect</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name, email address, company name, billing information,
            and any details you provide when creating an account, subscribing, or contacting us.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Log data such as pages visited, referrers, approximate location
            (country/region), device type, and general usage patterns. We use this to operate, maintain,
            and improve our services.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Technical Data:</strong> IP address, device information, and basic diagnostic data used
            for security, fraud prevention, and service reliability.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-2">
        For privacy-friendly analytics we use Plausible Analytics, which provides aggregated statistics
        without using cookies or collecting personal data such as full IP addresses or persistent identifiers.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Public content and reviews</h4>
    <p>
        As part of our services, Spydomo collects and analyzes publicly available content about companies,
        such as reviews on software marketplaces, public forum posts, and social media discussions related
        to software tools and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where we collect public content that may include personal information (for example names or usernames
        in reviews), we primarily use it to generate aggregated and anonymized insights about companies.
        We do not build profiles of individuals, and we limit our retention of raw content to the period
        necessary to produce these summaries.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Your Information</h4>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, and improve our services</li>
        <li>Process payments and manage subscriptions</li>
        <li>Send important notifications and product updates</li>
        <li>Respond to support requests and provide customer service</li>
        <li>Monitor usage, ensure security, and prevent abuse or fraud</li>
        <li>Understand how Spydomo is used in aggregate so we can make better product decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">3. Sharing of Information</h4>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted third parties who help us deliver our services
            (for example, payment processors, email delivery providers, hosting providers, and our
            privacy-focused analytics provider, Plausible Analytics). They are only allowed to use your data
            as needed to perform services on our behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legal Authorities:</strong> If required by law, court order, or to protect our rights,
            users, or the public.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">4. Data Security</h4>
    <p>
        We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access,
        loss, misuse, or disclosure. However, no system is 100% secure.
        Please use strong passwords and protect your account credentials.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">5. Data Retention</h4>
    <p>
        We keep your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the services,
        maintain security, resolve disputes, and fulfill the purposes described in this policy,
        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, we may retain billing and invoice records for several years to comply with
        tax and accounting obligations, even after you close your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we no longer need your personal information, we will delete it or anonymize it so that
        it can no longer be linked back to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also retain anonymized or aggregated data (such as overall statistics about products
        or companies) after your account is closed, as this data no longer identifies you or your
        organization.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">6. Your Choices & Control</h4>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update your personal information in your account settings (where available)</li>
        <li>Unsubscribe from non-essential emails using the link in those messages</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your account and associated personal data, subject to legal obligations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you need help managing your data, you can contact us at
        <a href="mailto:info@spydomo.com">info@spydomo.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">7. International Users</h4>
    <p>
        Spydomo is based in Canada and may process and store your data in Canada or other countries.
        These countries may have different data protection laws than your country of residence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where required, we take steps to ensure an appropriate level of protection for your personal data
        in accordance with applicable laws (for example, using data processing agreements with our providers).
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">8. GDPR Compliance (for EU/EEA & UK Users)</h4>
    <p>
        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, you have specific
        rights under data protection laws such as the GDPR and the UK GDPR. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The right to access, correct, or delete your personal data</li>
        <li>The right to object to or restrict the processing of your data</li>
        <li>The right to data portability</li>
        <li>The right to withdraw consent at any time (when processing is based on consent)</li>
        <li>The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We act as the “data controller” for your personal information. If you wish to exercise any of these rights,
        please email us at <a href="mailto:info@spydomo.com">info@spydomo.com</a>.
        We will respond as required by applicable law (typically within 30 days).
    </p>
    <p>We only process your data when we have a legal basis to do so, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your consent</li>
        <li>The necessity to perform a contract with you (e.g., providing the service you signed up for)</li>
        <li>Compliance with a legal obligation</li>
        <li>
            Our legitimate interests (for example, product improvement, security, preventing fraud),
            provided those interests are not overridden by your rights and interests
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For more information about the third-party service providers we use to deliver Spydomo,
        see our <a href="/subprocessors">Subprocessors</a> page.
    </p>


    <h4 class="mt-4">9. Cookies & Analytics</h4>
    <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies to make Spydomo work securely and reliably.
        At this stage, we primarily use <strong>essential cookies</strong>, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authentication cookies to keep you logged in</li>
        <li>Security-related cookies (for example, to help prevent fraud or abuse)</li>
        <li>Basic preferences that help the site function as expected</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For website analytics, we use Plausible Analytics, a privacy-focused, cookieless analytics service.
        Plausible does not use cookies, does not collect personal data such as full IP addresses, and only
        provides us with aggregated statistics about traffic and usage patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because our analytics setup does not rely on tracking cookies or personal data, and because we only use
        essential cookies for core functionality, you generally will not see a cookie consent banner when using Spydomo.
        If this changes in the future (for example, if we introduce additional non-essential cookies
        or marketing tools), we will update this policy and ask for your consent where required by law.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings. However, disabling essential cookies
        may affect your ability to use key parts of the service (such as logging in).
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">10. Children’s Privacy</h4>
    <p>
        Spydomo is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors.
        If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">11. Changes to This Policy</h4>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an
        updated “Effective Date.” We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">12. Contact Us</h4>
