    <p>Welcome to Spydomo. By accessing or using our website, products, or services, you agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h4>
    <p>
        By using Spydomo, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old, are a human (no bots or automated signups),
        and agree to comply with and be legally bound by these terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our services.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">2. Use of the Service</h4>
    <p>
        Spydomo provides tools and insights for tracking market signals and competitive intelligence.
        You agree to use our services for lawful purposes only and not for any unauthorized, fraudulent,
        or malicious activities, or in violation of any laws or regulations applicable in your jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">3. Account Responsibility</h4>
    <p>
        If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your login credentials
        and for all activity that occurs under your account, including activity by other users invited under
        your client account.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must provide accurate information when signing up, including your legal name and a valid email address.
        Spydomo is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from your failure to keep your account secure
        or your credentials confidential.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">4. Subscription, Free Trial &amp; Billing</h4>
    <p>
        Access to certain features of Spydomo may require a paid subscription. We may offer a free trial;
        the length and conditions of any trial will be shown at signup. After the trial ends, you must start
        a paid subscription to keep using the service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring basis (for example, monthly) via our payment
        provider (such as Stripe). By subscribing, you authorize us and our payment provider to charge your
        chosen payment method for the applicable fees and any taxes.
    </p>
    <p>
        All fees are non-refundable, except where refunds are required by applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period. You’ll retain access until then and you 
        will not receive a refund for any unused time.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you downgrade your plan (for example, reduce the number of companies you track), the change takes effect immediately and your new limits apply right away. 
        We do not provide refunds or credits for downgrades, although we may apply prorated charges when you upgrade during a billing period.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you upgrade your subscription (for example, by adding more tracked companies), the upgrade may
        take effect immediately and we may prorate the fees for the remainder of the current billing period.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">5. Intellectual Property &amp; Content Ownership</h4>
    <p>
        All content, logos, trademarks, and software used to provide Spydomo are the property of Spydomo or its
        licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, reverse
        engineer, or distribute any part of our service without our explicit permission.
    </p>
    <p>
        You retain ownership of the content and data you submit to Spydomo. By using the service, you grant us
        a limited license to use, process, and store that content as necessary to operate and improve the service.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to send us feedback, suggestions, or ideas, you agree that we may use them without any
        obligation to compensate or attribute them to you.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">6. Data &amp; Privacy</h4>
    <p>
        We care about your privacy. Our use of your personal information is governed by our
        <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. By using our services, you consent to such use.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Data Processing</strong></p>
    <p>
        To the extent Spydomo processes personal data on your behalf in connection with the services,
        our Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") applies and is incorporated into these Terms by reference.
        By using Spydomo, you agree to the DPA available at
        <a href="/dpa">https://spydomo.com/dpa</a>
        (or any successor URL we may designate).
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">7. Service Availability &amp; Modifications</h4>
    <p>
        We strive for uptime and reliability, but we do not guarantee that the service will always be available,
        uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the service
        at any time, with or without notice.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">8. Cancellation &amp; Termination</h4>
    <p>
        You can cancel your subscription at any time from within your account settings. Unless otherwise stated,
        your cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period, and you will not be charged again.
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account, or refuse current or future use of the service,
        if we reasonably believe you are misusing the service, violating these terms, or engaging in unlawful or
        abusive behavior.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">9. Limitation of Liability</h4>
    <p>
        Spydomo is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
        we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss
        of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities arising out of or in connection with your use of the service.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">10. Changes to Terms</h4>
    <p>
        We may update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you,
        for example by email or by posting a notice on our website or within the app. Your continued use of
        the service after changes take effect means you accept the updated terms.
    </p>
